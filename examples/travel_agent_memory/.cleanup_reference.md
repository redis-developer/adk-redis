# Cleanup Reference

## What Happened

The `travel_agent_memory` directory was reorganized on 2026-01-30.

---

## Actions Taken

### 1. Deleted (5 files)
Old agent versions were permanently removed:
- `travel_agent_with_tools.py`
- `travel_agent_with_tools_simple.py`
- `travel_agent_with_web_search.py`
- `travel_agent_without_tools.py`
- `tavily_tool.py`

**Reason:** Superseded by consolidated `travel_agent/` package.

---

### 2. Moved to `debug/` (6 files - gitignored)
Debug and test scripts:
- `compare_journey.py`
- `run_with_logs.sh`
- `simple_demo.py`
- `test_tool_direct.py`
- `test_tools_simple.py`
- `travel_scenarios.py`

**Access:** Still available locally in `debug/` directory.

---

### 3. Moved to `docs/` (11 files - gitignored)
Historical planning and phase documentation:
- `CLEANUP_PLAN.md`
- `EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md`
- `FEATURE_PARITY_ANALYSIS.md`
- `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
- `IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`
- `PHASE1_COMPLETE.md`
- `PHASE1_TEST_RESULTS.md`
- `PHASE2_COMPLETE.md`
- `PHASE3_COMPLETE.md`
- `PHASE3_SUMMARY.md`
- `STATUS.md`

**Access:** Still available locally in `docs/` directory.

---

### 4. Updated `.gitignore`
Added:
```
examples/travel_agent_memory/debug/
examples/travel_agent_memory/docs/
```

"""Load sample data into Redis for the redis_search_tools demo.

Data is designed to demonstrate when different search tools excel:
- Semantic search: conceptual queries, synonyms, paraphrasing
- Keyword search: technical terms, acronyms, exact phrases
- Range search: finding all highly relevant docs above threshold
